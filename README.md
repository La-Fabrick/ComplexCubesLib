# Complex Cubes Lib

Complex Cubes Lib is a library adding complex numbers to Minecraft.

You must include this lib inside your jar (with ShadowJar for example) because we will not build our project as an independent
Minecraft plugin.

This lib is using Apache Commons Numbers to provide complex numbers, angles and more.
Check it [here](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-numbers/).
